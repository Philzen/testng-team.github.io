=== Overriding test methods

:url: https://javadoc.io/static/org.testng/testng/{version-label}

TestNG allows you to override and possibly skip the invocation of test methods.
One example of where this is useful is if you need to your test methods with a specific security manager. You achieve this by implementing the interface {url}/org/testng/IHookable.html[IHookable] inside either your test class (or) in your base class from which your test classes extend.

Here is an example with JAAS:

[source, java]

----
public class MyHook implements IHookable {
  public void run(final IHookCallBack icb, ITestResult testResult) {
    // Preferably initialized in a @Configuration method
    mySubject = authenticateWithJAAs();

    Subject.doAs(mySubject, new PrivilegedExceptionAction() {
      public Object run() {
        icb.callback(testResult);
      }
    };
  }
}
----
